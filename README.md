### ‚öôÔ∏è Version 1.0.0 ‚Äì Fully compatible with Turtle WoW (1.12 Client)

**AutoStatusAnnouncer** is a lightweight, 100% Vanilla-safe addon that automatically announces your **health (HP)**, **mana (MP)**, **damage taken**, and **death** in chat.

It‚Äôs designed for **party, raid, or duo play**, helping your teammates react faster when you‚Äôre low on HP or mana without needing to type anything.
